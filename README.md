#  E-Commerce Sales Data Analysis (IBM Cloud – No-Code Project)

A no-code data analytics project performed entirely using IBM Cloud data tools. This project includes data cleaning, exploration, and visualization done **without writing a single line of code**, relying fully on IBM Cloud's built‑in features. This project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis skills, from raw CSV data to meaningful business insights.

##  Project Overview

This project analyzes online sales data containing information such as:

* Order and delivery dates
* Customer locations and zones
* Delivery types
* Product categories and subcategories
* Pricing, shipping fees, and order quantities
* Order status (Delivered / Returned)
* Ratings and revenue

The goal is to understand **sales performance**, **customer behavior**, **delivery efficiency**, and **product trends** through data cleaning and visualization.

##  Objectives

* Clean and preprocess raw sales data
* Identify sales trends over time
* Analyze product category performance
* Explore customer distribution by region/zone
* Compare delivery types and their impact
* Examine return patterns and customer ratings
* Visualize key metrics for actionable insights

---

##  Data Cleaning Steps

* Handled missing values
* Corrected date formats
* Standardized category names
* Removed inconsistent numerical entries
* Created additional columns such as Month, Year, Revenue
* Verified data types for accurate analysis

---

##  Visualizations Created

The project includes several charts to communicate insights such as:

* Revenue trends
* Order volume over time
* Product category comparisons
* Revenue by zone/location
* Delivery method breakdown
* Returned vs delivered orders
* Rating distributions

These visualizations highlight patterns in customer buying behavior and overall store performance.

##  Key Insights

* Certain product categories contribute the highest revenue
* Some zones generate more orders than others
* Express deliveries are often linked to different customer behavior compared to other methods
* Returned items commonly show lower ratings

##  Tools & Platform

* IBM Cloud Pak for Data
* IBM Watson Studio (no‑code tools)
* IBM Data Refinery (for cleaning and transformations)
* IBM Visualization features (for charts and dashboards)
